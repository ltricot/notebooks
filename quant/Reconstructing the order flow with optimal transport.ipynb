    "Exchanges receive three types of orders:\n",
    "- **Limit orders**, making liquidity\n",
    "- **Market orders**, taking liquidity\n",

    "Limit orders are standing offers to buy (sell) a defined amount at a defined price. They can be cancelled using Cancel orders. Market orders are orders to buy a defined amount at market price: the best price which can be achieved using standing offers. Limit orders are accumulated and aggregated into a tick level order book, which contains the size of aggregated standing offers at each price. Market orders trigger one or more trades when they are matched with one or more Limit orders.\n",
